# Dynamics of Infectious Diseases

This is my individual research project during year 1 of my degree at Imperial College London. The topic is Dynamics of the SEIR Model with Limited Hospital Treatment and it is described in the pdf file.

The pdf file is the final version of the project, containing its description. The python file contains the code used to solve the system of differential equations and produce the plots in the poster.

The LaTeX folder contains the script of the poster written in Overleaf toghether with the necessary files to produce the poster.
